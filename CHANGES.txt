CHANGES AND BUGFIXES
------------------------------

 0.1 -> 0.2: (19.06.2014)

	or via the config.properties file
-> F1-F5 keys can be used to toggle the visibiliy of printspace/text regions/lines/baselines/words

0.2.1:

-> Global font style is stored in config file
-> BUILD.txt specifies the current version and the build date and time

0.3.2: (23.07.2014)
-> Applying the font-styles now behaves different: font-size and kerning of 0 and an empty font-family  
	are NOT applied to sub-elements to avoid erasing this information!
 	NOTE: boolean values (serif yes/no, monospace yes/no, bold yes/no etc.) are still applied
 	 to each level and thus the original information gets erased!
-> Different apply buttons for structure and text-styles

0.4:
-> Indexed tagging and general custom tags

0.4.1:
-> Bugfixes
-> Changed SWT version from 4.3 to 4.4

-> Tagging of multiple different words selected in canvas

0.4.5:
-> Bugfixes: editing in transcription widgets (word and line based) was broken in some cases
-> added text undo/redo in transcription widgets
-> Integrated XML source file viewer now has search functionality

0.4.6:
-> Changes over multiple lines should now be possible in the line transcription widget and behave as such:
	- if the number of lines inserted is greater than the number of affected lines (i.e. the marked lines), 
		the excessive newline characters are replaced with whitespaces to guarentee insertion of the whole text 
	- if the number of lines inserted is less than the number of affected lines, the remaining affected lines will be cleared
-> Removed bug that selected parent region after any edit operation
-> Fixed another memory leak problem
-> Added login info (username & server) in doc-overview tab

0.4.7:

-> Some urgent bugfixes: 
	* Deleting words in word transcription editor not possible
	* Tagging / text style adding was buggy too
	* concurrent modification exceptions in doc view
-> Save dialog appears on exit if unsaved changes exist

0.4.8:
	-> Sorting functionality in doc overview
	-> doc overview: do not show public documents
	-> Program updater can overwrite config files
	-> Install a specific version of the tool via Menu->Install a specific version...
	
0.4.9:
	-> Reading order editing via the "Structure" view. 
		* Note: Once a reading order is defined inside a page / region / line, the elements get sorted  by this reading order first and then the coordinates!
		* You can auto-set the reading order according to the coordinates using the respective buttons in the "Structure" tab
		* The reading order is implemented on shape level via a custom tag called "readingOrder" with an integer value that determines the order.
		* If the reading order is equal for two shapes at a certain level, shapes are sorted by their coordinates.
		* If a reading order is set for some shape and not set for the other, the shape with the reading order comes first.
		* When saving the file a reading order on region level is also saved to the corresponding PAGE XML element ('ReadingOrder').
		Reading orders on other levels (lines / words) are not saved in this way, since the file cannot be loaded with Alethia anymore. 
		* Also, a reading order on region level set by the Alethia tool is synchronized with the custom tags on a page load.
		
	-> Adding of baselines, lines and words without their parent region -> if the parent region is not found, 
	the user is asked if he wants to automatically add the corresponding parent region.
	There is also a new toggle button (square shape with a plus) that when toggled disables this question.
	The corresponding property in the config.properties file is 'autoCreateParent'.
	
	-> Drag-and-Drop support in the "Structure" tab: elements can be moved from one parent to another via drag and drop, 
		i.e: lines can be moved to another region, words can be moved to another line.
		The drop has to be performed *onto* a region / line
		Note: it is not checked, whether the new parent region geometrically overlaps its new children -> use this option with care!
		
	-> Pasting multiple lines in the line transcription editor now fills up empty lines after the selection index if possible
	
0.5.0:
	-> Bugfixes (as always...)
	-> Finish a shape on doubleclick
	-> Polyrectangles (instead of just rectangles) are automatically created as parent shapes for baselines

	-> on upload of document you can now specify the collection to upload to; if no collection with necessary rights exists, you can create one
	-> changing name of collections possible
	(-> resolved nasty "invisible top toolbar on window resize in windows when document loaded" bug - hopefully...)
	-> The program updater now also works via https only (default) -> property 'useFtpProgramUpdater' in config.properties adjusts if program updates are done via ftp or https
	
0.5.9:
	-> introudced options item in canvas toolbar (wrench symbol) -> summarizes all options for drawing new elements

	-> Add login btn to toolbar
	-> bugfix: clear doc table filter when loading another collection
	-> bugfix: Speed up 'Add page(s) to document' in document manager
	-> Enable export of versions created by some 'tool', User get selection of all 'toolnames' which have run on that document
	-> User activity: Shows a edit history per collection - more specifically sees the latest 'saves' and 'status changes' for each page and can also load that page with double click
	-> 'Compare Text Differences Tool' does not block, and (if wished) it shows the line numbering like the text editor
	-> Automatic saving tool: Stores transcript of a page from time to time locally to the user directory. If user loads a remote page it checks if a local version exists and if it is newer then the version on the server - if so it can be stored to the server. Settings can be made via the 'Save button' drop down menu.
	-> Option to change the reading order for all subsequent shapes as well, e.g. ro '35' changes to '3', afterwards '36' to '4', '37' to '5', '38' to '6' till the end of the shape list with the same parent.

	-> new sync txt-files and PAGE-XMLs with existing doc dialog (including: apply txt-files to existing layouts)
	-> text editor: 'Backspace' and 'Ctrl+Return' behavior - moves text one line up or down; Use case: applying txt-files to existing layouts may start at the wrong line which can be corrected
	-> HTR+ training using base models
	-> enable gzip encoding for HTTP API connection
	-> new HTR options regarding the line segments produced by CITlab HTR
		-> "Do polygon simplification": reduce the complexity of line segments, saving bandwidth and storage space.
