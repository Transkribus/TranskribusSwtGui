
-> To deploy a new version you have to change the <version> parameter in the pom.xml.
	The syntax of the version should always be: <major>-<minor>-<revision>[-<modifier>]
	Use 'mvn deploy' to deploy the package to the SVN and/or dea_scratch etc.
	Two deploy options are available depending on the format of the version string: 
	
	1.) Release version: empty or non snapshot modifier, e.g. '0.4.3', '0.4.4-RELEASE' ...
		Those versions are deployed to the svn server under the subfolder "releases" and the current version is also updated in the
		BUILD.txt file which is uploaded to the ftp to quickly check the latest version for the internal program updater
	2.) modifier set to SNAPSHOT, e.g. 0.4.3-SNAPSHOT
		Those version are deployed to the svn server under the subfolder "snapshots" and are intended for snapshot version of the program

-> If the SWT version is set to 4.4 you need to set the SWT_GTK3 environment variable to 0 (export SWT_GTK3=0) to *not* use 
gtk3, which is buggy for linux with SWT!
	However, if you use SWT version 4.3 the variable SWT_GTK3 must not be set at all, since if it is set to any value, the
	program will use gtk3 and thus produces a broken program...
	
	In the startup script for linux (TrpGui.sh) the variable will automatically be set according to the SWT version that is present
	in the libs directory (TODO).
	
	Manually set SWT_GTK3 variable if you start the program directly e.g. in Eclipse via Run-Configurations->Environment tab
	
->  In Eclipse use the TrpMainWidget class to start the program, within the packaged application use the TrpGui class which 
explicitely loads the correct SWT jar for the current platform (this won't work inside eclipse!)

-> if mvn install fails on Ubuntu saying ".../windres -> file not found" (or something like that) you have to install the 32bit compatibility libs:
	sudo apt-get install lib32ncurses5 lib32z1
